# Text Editor

## Description

The goal was an efficient text editor in the browser that could work offline and be capable of working on all browsers. The purpose of this project was to utilize PWA functions in the making of this project. Using IndexDB, Workbox, and Webpacks for proper PWA functioning has been a learning experience to say the least, but it wasn't as bad as I thought, but I feel I need to spend some more time with PWA to get an even better grasp because I feel like I spent way more time behind the scenes than I wanted to. The site was successfully deployed on Heroku and you can find the link below.
